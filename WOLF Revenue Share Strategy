WOLF Revenue Share Strategy
1. Revenue Sources

WOLF will collect revenue from the following ecosystem services:

Launchpad Fees – Listing fees, percentage of raised capital, or token allocations.

Trading Bot Volume – Monthly or weekly volume based, tiered by features.

Market Making/ Dex aggregator – Spread fees, partner project support fees, and liquidity provisioning profits.

Ecosystem Fees – Transaction fees from swaps, staking, or additional token launches built on WOLF.

Native token fee - Transaction fees from swaps (2% tax per swap)

2. Allocation of Revenue

Revenue generated will be distributed as follows:

40% → Community Stakers + holders (Revenue Sharing Pool) + Automatic airdrops

Distributed proportionally to $WOLF stakers + Holders.

Rewards are paid in stablecoins (USDT/USDC) or in $WOLF, depending on treasury strategy.

25% → Buyback & Burn Mechanism

Automated token buybacks reduce circulating supply.

Burned tokens create deflationary pressure, supporting token value.

20% → Development & Operations

Ensures long-term sustainability.

Covers security audits, dev team salaries, infrastructure, partnerships.

10% → Marketing & Growth

Expands brand visibility.

Used for influencer partnerships, exchange listings, and community incentives.

5% → DAO Treasury Reserve

Allocated to a community-governed fund.

Future ecosystem expansions, grants, or emergency needs.
